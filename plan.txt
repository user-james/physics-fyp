THIS IS A GENERAL OUTLINE OF THE FINAL REPORT
_________________________________________________

two refractive indices to be used -------> 3.15, 3.5

INTRO:
    - History of waveguides (maybe even sound)
    - Waveguides size and application range
    - (Light) Method of propogation (total internal reflection)
    - Propogation equations <-> similarities between Helmholtz and Schrodinger equations
    - Finite difference methods intro


METHODS:
    - 1D case -> analytical derivation (include numerical part) find length where 2nd mode disappears
              -> numerical solutions
              -> compare

    - 2D case -> no analytical soln
              -> approximate methods
              -> numerical solution
              -> ERROR in scaling discuss
              -> change size until mode disappears compare with 1D
